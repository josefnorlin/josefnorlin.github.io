Because of price and limited or no upgradeability for Macs today alternatives start to look more and more tempting. If you are a developer like me, but also dependant on Adobe's Creative Suite here's how you can use Windows Subsystem for Linux and some keybinding to get your PC work quite as good as your Mac for a lot less.

## 1. Set Up Windows Subsystem for Linux 2

## 2. Install Your Linux-flavour
Apple isn't leading the mobile phone development anymore. Look at the video ad below for examples of that. One of the latest feature Samsung beat Apple on is to use the phone as a desktop computer. All you need is an adapter, mouse, keyboard and screen and you're up and running. You might say, well, Apple doesn't lead but when they release a new feature they do a great job. Only problem is, Samsung and many others do a great job too. And often even surpassing Apple. Yes, iCloud, I'm looking at you.

## 3. Use Windows Terminal with Oh My Zsh
In Sweden by 30th of September 2018 an iPhone XS with 64 GB costs 12'489 SEK ($1'405), Samsung S9 with 64 GB costs 6'090 SEK ($685). So basically half the money. If the iPhone would be superior I would get it but I'm arguing its the opposite. I would say it's twice the price for an inferior phone. The Samsung S9 even comes with a memory card reader making its storage expandable. The day you need more space you can add it, not spending an extra 3'000 SEK upfront to get 192 GB more. 200 GB extra for a Samsung S9 would cost under 400 SEK. Not only is that close to 1/10 of the price, you can reuse your MicroSD card in your next phone/camera too.

## 4. Set up your VS Code
Ever tried to open an iPhone X(S/R) with part of your face covered by your pillow? Or while sneak-peaking at it from an angle? Face-ID is a great marketing tool but truth be told there are better ways to unlock your phone. Samsung has Face-ID technologies too but also includes a fingerprint reader on the back which I found far superior. While lifting my phone I can activate it just by holding it and the phone unlocks even before my eyes reach it making the otherwise mandatory "selfie look" at the iPhone X unnecessary. Just count how many times you unlock your phone everyday and count the extra seconds it costs you. iPhones doesn't present your apps directly either but shows you your "lock screen"-unlocked which makes even more seconds tick.

## 5. Customize your Keybindings to match your Mac

> Want to charge and listen to music? Or just listening on your Bluetooth headset that just ran out on juice. No problem, just bring one or two adapters to your iPhone.

## To conclude...
If you're happy with your iPhone and want a smooth transition to something "old-new" go ahead get a new one. My only aim is to make everyone aware that things have changed over the recent years. Even if it's some hassle switching, the experience replacing my iPhone with a Samsung Android was like switching from my old SonyEricsson to my first iPhone 3G back in the day. You may need to move some contacts to your Gmail-account and install the apps you use again and setting them up, but if you're up for it's worth the challenge.
