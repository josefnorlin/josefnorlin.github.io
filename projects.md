As a kid I liked the Linux penguin, Tux. Imagine my disappointment when I installed Red Hat (most popular Linux distribution back then) and didn't see the Linux Penguin anywhere. 15 years later I decided to do something about it and created the Tux4Ubuntu Initiative to bring Tux to the OSes he powers. Starting with Ubuntu I've created a boot selection, boot loader theme and bundled it with other Tux software in a simple bash-installer.  [Jump to Tux4Ubuntu.org](https://tux4ubuntu.org)
